 We deal with 3 types of exceptions:
 1. C++ exceptions from our C++ flatbuffers code (which Swift or ObjC don't really account for,
    so need to be caught and converted where we make the C++ calls).
 2. Swift "exceptions" (actually NSError** return parameters), which a Swift (or Objective-C)
    program can "catch" and recover from.
 3. Objective-C exceptions. These are basically a C++ exception under the hood, but are intended
    only for use for programming errors. Throwing Objective-C exceptions through AppKit or UIKit
    API can lead to memory leaks and instability. If a function called by Swift receives an
    Objective-C exception, Swift terminates the application.
